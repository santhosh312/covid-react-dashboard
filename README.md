This project **Covid19 Dashboard** is built using React.

The website is responsive and both **class componnents** and **functional components** are used. The data is fetched by consuming an api and **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts are used to display the fetched data for different routes.

Third party packages like **recharts**, **react-icons** and **react-loader-spinner** are used.
